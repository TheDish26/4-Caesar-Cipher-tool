# 4-Caesar-Cipher-tool
This project provides a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions.
# Caesar Cipher Tool

## Overview
This is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique that shifts characters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions. The tool can be used to both encrypt and decrypt messages, providing a simple demonstration of cryptography.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pip (for managing dependencies)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git

## Example Usage
After installing dependencies and setting up the project, you can run the following commands:
- Encrypt a message:
  ```bash
  python caesar_cipher.py encrypt "Hello World" --shift 5

python caesar_cipher.py decrypt "Mjqqt Btwqi" --shift 5
